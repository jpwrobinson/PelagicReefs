Tidal datasets

31st October 2025



**TED forJames**

I think for now the best thing to do is to use the 'grid cell' estimates in the attached data file as intra-island replicates and use the 'mean' value (Column C) for each grid cell (this is the same data file I previously sent).

**360 version**

 Here, instead of summarizing by 100-m grid cells running around the coastline circumference of each island, we resampled the TED data using 10 degree circular bins (assuming each island as a circle). 

Again, I would use the mean value for each degree bin as intra-island replicates. 

 



I would hope at an island mean level the two versions of the data should converge on similar answers, but it might be worth playing with these too....in case they result in better model performance.
